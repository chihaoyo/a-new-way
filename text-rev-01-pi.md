# PI: A new system of organizing people and information as mean to very-large-scale collaboration

This project is creating a new system of organizing people and information, code-named **PI**, as a mean to facilitate collaboration within communities of very large scale.

Contrasting from various traditional modes of collaboration, **PI** is a platform and process rethought to bring people together without hierarchy, empower them with well-architected information, and facilitate democratic discourse and decision-making. It is conceived with enthusiasm to raise awareness about our responsibility as citizen of communities, strengthen or create such community, and push the evolution of our society forward.

At its inception, **PI** is designed with cities in mind as its primary target of deployment. This project will ensure that **PI** functions robustly with a heterogenous, diverse population which has geographic proximity and a certain level of cultural commonality.

Via various methods such as social experiments, participatory art projects, and installations in public domain will be conducted on groups of different sizes, to investigate and provide experience to the participant, the nature of collaboration. With the help of information and sensory technology, the observation and documentation of these experiments then serve as input to the design of **PI**. Various prototypes will be made ranging from interface, software application, sensor modules, wearable device, to build a wide array of different elements that will eventually form the project as a whole.

The development of **PI** will always be an organic process. It may adjust direction or shift entirely due to unforeseen events. It is, by its nature, extremely open to collaboration, as the scale and the spectrum of the scale and the spectrum of expertise of this project is extensive.

There are many things need fixing in our society today that are too big and important for any individual or group of people to decide. **PI** is a tool rethinking the process which we assemble, deliberate, and reach consensus. It promises the true power of democracy when every one of us can work together and decide what is right for us all.
