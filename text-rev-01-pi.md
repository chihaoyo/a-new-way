This project is creating new system of organizing people and information, in order to facilitate collaboration in a very large scale, code-named **PI**. 

Contrasting from various traditional modes of collaboration, **PI** is a platform and process rethought to bring people together without hierarchy, empower them with well-architected information, and facilitate democratic discourse and decision-making. It is conceived with enthusiasm to raise awareness about our responsibility as citizen of communities, strengthen or create such community, and push the evolution of our society forward.

Via various methods such as social experiments, participatory art projects, and installations in public domain, simple experiments will be conducted on groups of different sizes, to investigate and provide experience to the participant, the nature of collaboration. With the help of information and sensory technology, the observation and documentation of these experiments then serve as input to the design of **PI**.

At its inception, **PI** is designed to be deployed on a city level. Attempts will be made to design **PI** to work with a heterogenous, diverse population with geographic proximity and a certain level of cultural commonality. Various prototypes will be made ranging from interface, software application, sensor modules, wearable device, and so on, to build a full array of different elements and forms of **PI**.

The development of **PI** is an organic process. It may adjust direction or shift entirely due to unforeseen events. It is extremely open to collaboration as the scale and the spectrum of the scale and the spectrum of expertise of this project is extensive.

There are many things need fixing in our society today that are too big and important for any individual or even a group of people to decide what is right. **PI** is a tool to bring out the power of true democracy, so that we can all work and decide together what is right for us all.
