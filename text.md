## Background

We live in a society consists of interconnected, complex systems. The production and labour system, the financial system, legal system, education system, and the political system. They define parameters and form preferences around which each of our lives is conducted and our choices are made. 

Different institutions embody and practice the ideas and purposes of each of these systems. They act with far greater power than any of the individuals who has formed and empowered them. It is these institutions which effectively shape the society today, thus the lives of every one of us. However, it is often the case that these institutions are becoming not a greenhouse, but obstructions against creativity and change, both internal and external.

Institutions are so common in our lives these days that in our day-to-day conversations, we talk of them as if they were people like us. It is easy to say things for the ease of communication,  and we rarely think about the ramification of such over-simplification. There is real danger, in this case, behind anthropomorphism, this unconscious equation we all have between man-made objects and men. By making institutions sound like people, we risk of blurring the line of responsibility. We tend to forget that institutions are made of people. Ultimately, only people have the instruments of intelligence. Only people can make decisions. Only people can act upon the physical world. Institutions are not people. They do not have families or friends. They do not have emotions or believes. People do. Institutions are machines, people are not.

Coincidentally, the principle of "division of labour" tempts to take humanity out of us, and make us machines that are parts of a bigger machine. It encourages us to focus our attention on specific tasks, leaving us no extra time to take a look at the bigger picture, nor the energy to do something about the things we do not like. It has made our current system of production and labour "efficient and productive" in a global scale, produced goods to sustain the "modernized sector" of the world's population. It has also reduced the value of our lives to a list of job descriptions, divided and alienated ourselves from each other. When a person is put behind a desk, a name tag, or a business card, he or she would instantly become, from an independent being, a part of something foreign, unfamiliar, and much larger than his or her own identity. Belongingness and duty take over individuality and moral. Principles become policies, work ethic overrides ethics. When people do things mindlessly, falling into technicality without considering the consequences of his or her action, that's the banality of evil.

One particular type of institution where this phenomenon is easily visible is the financial institutions, operated on the basis of the modern money mechanics. We simply do not question  the existence of these powerful institution. Money is such an essential existence to our day lives, our past, present, and future relies on money. However, money nowadays is created out of debt due to the worldwide adoption of the fractional reserve banking system. Maurizio Lazzarato speaks in his essay _The Making of the Indebted Man_ that "every man is born indebted." This leaves us no choice except to participate in the society as is as soon as we can to repay that debt. To question such existing society is a luxury that most of us simply cannot afford to have. 

Once something is taken for granted, it gains a life of its own, evolving unnoticed, uncontrolled. Each of these systems that forms our society has, since before any of us alive on earth was born, grown to such complexity that it is just too intimidating for any one of us to try to tackle on his own, even if they want to. These systems also influence each other. They are indeed interconnected. The way each of them operate is both the cause and consequence of the operations of the others. They have become so overwhelmingly big and pervasive that we as individuals cannot anymore understand, let alone control, these of our own collective creation.

To crack these systems, we have disciplines in academia to study them, adopting scientific approach, the legitimate way of studying any phenomenon in the universe. Hypotheses and theories are produced by researchers and scholars in academia. By nature of the academia, it discloses its finding without judgment. It avoids being political. This way, the so called, if ever existed, neutrality of academia can be preserved, while if it is or not beneficial for the society remains highly questionable.

Theories are always theories. They hold under certain assumptions. The complexity of these systems comes from the complexity of ourselves, and the interaction among ourselves as complex beings of choice. It is of absolute importance to have the insight from academic research. Yet we must not assume that the real world works like a vacuum in the space lab, as the free market advocates conveniently assume that people are rational beings, free to make every choice to maximize his own utility.


## Recapitulation

We live in a world where the power of the institutions are failing their purpose to serve the people. Banks are evil. Courts of law are unjust. Universities are for-profit. Governments are dysfunctional. These institutions are in control of our lives now, when the paradox is that it was us who built them in the first place.

We are consumers now, not citizens. We value our ability to consume more than our capability to reason and represent. The majority of us are reduced to tedious, repetitive tasks, bounded by paychecks in order to survive. We are constantly confronted and coerced by gigantic institutions and complex systems. Though the academia is conducting countless research projects all the time, the results seldom leave outside of journals, conferences, or classrooms to create change.


## Opportunities

There are two things we can still turn to, in order to turn this around. First, the power of ourselves. Informed as intellectuals, united as a community. Second, the power of technology. Information technologies in particular, open-source and distributed.

The challenges we face today are outcomes of our lack of engagement to the process of social decision-making. To re-engage ourselves, we need a new way to come together to comprehend and question the status quo, search and discourse on solutions, then finally reach some form of conclusion that serves the common interest and is good and right for humanity.


## A new way

Imagine a conference room sat with fifteen people. Now imagine thousands, or hundreds of thousands of people in one space. That is fearful and powerful at the same time. How can we make that space into a democratic platform of discourse? With this ambition in mind, we need something new.

We need a "new way" to converge information and opinions. It has to be far more out-reaching, efficient, democratic, and collaborative than anything we have today. This project is aimed at finding, or contributing in the finding of this "new way" to a better future.

Imagine how the discourse will unfold. First we have to recognize that there are challenges and they are pressing issues waiting to be addressed. Then we sit down together (metaphorically or not,) define those challenges, list reference resources, name research topics, think of possible scenarios, propose solutions, forecast outcome, adjust the preconditions accordingly, then try again. With the magnitude of the "discussion," the amount of ideas and perspectives that needs integration would be amazingly huge and extremely challenging.

(Big data of democratic discourse?)

Having that said, we need to look for some helping hands outside of our physical and biological limitations.

We are, and always will be, living at the peak of technological development, at least in the near future, where things invented are going obsolete in the matter of weeks, even days. The advance of technology is a reflection of our competitive and creative nature, striving to prove the capability of us as human beings. Innovations in both engineering and design over the years have extended our capabilities beyond anything we can ever imagine.

It is an interesting contrast to point out that while technology has advanced in great magnitude, the structure and rules of our society remain largely unchanged. Even with all the technologies in hand, people around the world are still filling out forms and hand them to clerks, over and over again. In many part of the world, it is not the question of availability anymore, but the tendency towards stability or change. It may even be fair to say that the way our society works has actually become an, if not the only, obstruction of creativity and innovation.

Perhaps this question is worth asking: How can we make the society adapt to us, the citizens, as quickly as technologies do, to fit the needs of the people?

The Internet is a great foundation to facilitate such change. It is pervasive, the entrance threshold is lowering rapidly. (The Google balloons!) It has a set of standards on top of a relatively global and independent infrastructure. We simply need a better tool of organizing all six billion different voices in one room.

We do have a way to do that. We elect representatives. We entrust our power to them to make them go into the governmental institutions to deliver our voice, in theory, in our stead. However, if we really look closely, representative democracy is essentially a compromise to the very principle of democracy. It is designed knowing that given the physical constraints, a fully direct democracy with no hierarchy was practically impossible to implement.

What if it is possible now? How can we get everyone in the room? Can we rapidly update the structure and rules of our society like never before?

Perhaps it is apt to call this "new way" "digital collaborative democracy." (DCD?) This new mode of democracy might just be an alternative paradigm for the society in general, and various institutions mentioned before which is currently structured hierarchically.


## Make the sidewalk safe again

Stealing an important observation from the book _The Death and Life of Great American Cities_ by Jane Jacobs, 1961, successful cities are those with safe sidewalks. How to keep the sidewalks safe? Not the frequent patrol of police, nor the densely deployed security cameras. It requires active public lives taking place on the sidewalks, and in the same time, a well-defined boundary, both physical and psychological, to protect what is private. This is a scenario that is analogous to the challenges we are facing today. A better society will protect and enrich the lives of those who helped building it. The sidewalk around those who built their houses facing away from it is never going to be a safe one to walk on.

How to bring "the public side" out of individuals is of paramount importance to the success of any public effort. This project will commit to raise the interest, lower the threshold for people to engage their time and energy in the public arena. It is not aiming to pull people out of _The Matrix_ and fight for humanity while living underground, traveling in pipes. It is aiming, however, to break the self-deceiving illusion that "there is nothing wrong" or the dishonest, passive thinking that "it is how it is" or "there is nothing we can do."

This project will make effort in two major areas. One, to keep people informed while maintaining boundary. Two, to provide a sense of purpose and belonging from creating a community.

Information is key to raise awareness and triggering actions. We are interconnected more than ever in the history of men and information is everywhere. However, we use that connectivity now for sheer entertainment, simply because that is all is provided with convenience. We must reverse our habit from consuming what is given to acquiring what is relevant.

This project will make sure that the delivery of relevant information be integrated into the everyday life seamlessly. The channel and the mechanism of delivering such information can be unconventional. Adopting strategies such as interactivity and gamification, combining good UX design with a sense of purpose,... It is ought to be a little obtrusive. It will interrupt people's daily routine, but in a different way.

People are forgetting fast nowadays. The mainstream media outlet now is designed to make sure that we forget what happened quick enough to avoid any deeper deliberation. Without the past as a reference point, there will be no place to ground ourselves on in this fast current of information. A well-designed, accessible, tagged, searchable archive of all information is vital for all the reason to help people remember...

This project will also create a community. Much like a group of volunteers, a cause, a belief that's shared among participants. Through the process of reaching consensus, participants will exchange ideas, challenge each other while creating something new together. With a good interaction and feedback system designed around that process, a community will form naturally. A common Chinese saying is this: you don't really know each other until you had a fight. (不打不相識)


## Outlook

A wide range of newly founded projects and phenomena are on the horizon. The freedom of information movement to make governments transparent, open-source hardware and 3D printing to democratize the means of production, social enterprises staring in Delaware, new models of localized micro economies emerging all over the world to put people before profit. These projects, in my personal believes, are growing to gradually replace the current, unsustainable version of capitalism and the so-called free market economy. 

This project is inspired by the talk _How the Internet Will (One Day) Transform Government_ in which Clay Shirky spoke enthusiastically about the technology that can bring forth the full potential of the power of a democratic group. Michael Sandel in his book _What Money Can't Buy_ speaks about the moral limit of the market. Whether any individual agrees or disagrees with his argument is of little significance. However, if we can have a platform where a large group of people can initiate, examine, debate, modify, agree on this list of things which money cannot buy, this list becomes legitimate and binding to those who signed up in the first place. It now has influence. From believes to impact.

This project is aiming to be the platform. The missing piece, the glue, the catalyst, and the stimulus of this type of new, self-directed, socially-aware, very-large-scale collaboration. To truly empower each and every member of the community, whether a city or a classroom, in the process of decision-making, to give power back to the people.


## Prototypes and experiments

Prototypes of this project will be built based on _git_, like _Github_, the web site on which this text is hosted. _git_ is a distributed version control system designed with the philosophy aligned with the ideal of this project. It allows all participants to have full access of the content of the project. It enables forking and merging, meaning there can be multiple versions of the project existing in the same time, and those versions can also be merged under different conditions.

The first iteration of the prototype will be building a collaborative graphical creative tool. It can be used to run experiments on groups of people under various conditions and goals that are traditionally achieved individually or collaboratively. Close observation will be done on the process of such collaboration with detailed documentation. Each stage of the outcome will be evaluated, and the feedback from the collaborators will be very important to consider as well.

Documenting the dynamics of collaboration is difficult. The Observer Effect illustrates that the act of observation changes the behavior, thus making the observation less true.
