## Background

We live in a society consists of interconnected, complex systems. The system of production and labour, the financial system, legal system, education system, and the political system. They define parameters and form preferences around which each of our lives is conducted and our choices are made. 

Different institutions embody the ideas and purposes of each of these systems. They act with far greater power than any of the individuals who has formed and empowered them. It is these institutions which effectively shape the society today, thus the lives of every one of us.

However, it is familiar for us to see these institutions become not a greenhouse, but an obstruction of creativity and change.

Intriguing changes happen when a person is put behind a desk, a name tag, or a business card. A person became from an independent being to a part of something external. Belongingness and duty take over individuality and moral. Principles become policies, work ethic overrides ethics.

In our day-to-day conversations, we talk of institutions as if they were people like us. There is real danger, in this case, behind anthropomorphism, this unconscious equation we all have between man-made objects and men. By making institutions sound like people, we risk to blur the line of responsibility. We tend to forget that institutions are made of people. Ultimately, only people have the instruments of intelligence. Only people can make decisions. Only people can act upon the physical world. Institutions are not people. It does not have family or friends. It does not have emotions or believes. People do. Institutions are machines, people are not.

Coincidentally, the principle of "division of labour" tempts to take humanity out of us, and make us a part of the machine. It encourages us to focus our attention on performing specific tasks, leaving us no extra time to take a look at the bigger picture, nor the energy to do something about things that we do not like. It  has made our current system of production and labour "efficient and productive" in a global scale, produced goods to sustain the modern sector of the world's population. It has also reduced the value of our lives to a list of job description, divided and alienated ourselves from each other.

And there is the monetary system based on debt. Every men is born indebted. This leaves us no choice except to participate in the society as is to repay that debt. The ability to question such existing society become a luxury that most of us simply cannot afford to have. On top of that, most of the time it just seems too intimidating for any one of us to try to tackle the entire system on his own. Each of these systems has made each other and evolved along with the entire history of the human kind. The way each of them operate is both the cause and consequence of the operations of the others. The scale and complexity of these systems have become so overwhelming that we as individuals cannot anymore understand, let alone control, these of our own collective creation.

For understanding these systems, we have disciplines in academia to study them using scientific approach, the legitimate way of studying any phenomenon in the universe. Hypotheses and theories are produced by researchers and scholars in academia. By nature of the academia, it discloses its finding without judgment, or in other words, being political. This way, the so called, if ever existed, neutrality of academia can be preserved, while if it is or not beneficial for the society remains highly questionable.

Theories are always theories. They hold under assumptions. The complexity of the systems of our society comes from the complexity of ourselves, and the interaction among ourselves as complex beings of choice. It is of absolute importance to have the insight from academic research. Yet we must not assume that the real world works like a vacuum in space, as the free market advocates conveniently assume that people are rational beings, free to make every choice to maximize his own utility.


## Recapitulation

We live in a world where the power of the institutions are failing their purpose to serve the people. Banks are evil. Courts of law are unjust. Universities are for-profit. Governments are dysfunctional. These institutions are in control of our lives now, when the paradox is that it was us who built them in the first place.

We are consumers now, not citizens. We value our ability to consume more than our capability to reason and represent. The majority of us are reduced to tedious, repetitive tasks, bounded by paychecks for their survival, confronted and coerced by gigantic institutions and complex systems. And though the academia is conducting countless research projects all the time, the results seldom leave outside of journals, conferences, or classrooms to result in change.


## Opportunities

There are two things we can still turn to, in order to turn this around. One, the power of ourselves, united as a group, informed as intellectuals. Second, the power of information technologies.

The challenges we face today are outcomes of our lack of engagement to the process of decision making. To re-engage ourselves, we need a new way to come together to understand and question the status quo, search and discourse on solutions, then finally reach some form of conclusion that serves the common interest and is good and right for humanity.


## A new way

A "new way" to converge information and opinions has to be far more out-reaching, efficient, democratic, and collaborative than anything we have today. And this project is aimed at finding, or contributing in the finding of this "new way."

Imagine a conference room sat with fifteen people. Now imagine thousands, or hundreds of thousands of people in the same space. That is powerful and fearful at the same time. How can we make that space into a democratic platform of discourse?

First we have to recognize that there are challenges and they are pressing issues waiting to be addressed. Then we sit down together, whether physically or not, define those challenges, list reference resources, name additional research topics, think of possible scenarios, propose solutions, forecast outcome, adjust the preconditions accordingly, then try again.

Having that said, we then look for some helping hands outside of our physical and biological limitations.

We are, and always will be, living at the peak of technology, at least in the near future, where things invented are going obsolete in the matter of weeks, even days. The advance of technology is the part of our nature, to strive to prove the capability of us as human beings. Innovations in both engineering and design have extended our capabilities beyond anything we can ever imagine.

However, it is an interesting contrast to point out that while technology has advanced in great magnitude over the years, the structure and rules of our society remain largely unchanged. Even with all the technologies in hand, people are still filling out forms around the world and hand them to clerks. It is not the question of invention, but deployment. It may even be fair to say that the way our society works has actually become an, if not the only, obstruction of creativity and innovation.

Perhaps this question is worth asking: How can the society adapt to us, the citizens, as quickly as technologies do, to fit the needs of the people?

The Internet is a great foundation to facilitate such change. It is pervasive, the entrance threshold is lowering rapidly. It has a set of standards on top of a relatively global and independent infrastructure. It is just that we need a better tool of organizing all the six billion different noise in the room.

We do have a way to do that. We elect representatives into the governmental institutions to deliver our voice, in theory, in our stead. However, if we really look closely, representative democracy is essentially a compromise to the very principle of democracy. It is designed knowing that given the physical constraints, a fully direct democracy with no hierarchy was practically impossible to implement.

What if it is possible now? How can we get everyone in the room now? Can we rapidly update our social structures and rules like never before?

Perhaps it is apt to call this "new way" "digital collaborative democracy."


## Bring out the public

Stealing an important observation from the book The Death and Life of Great American Cities by Jane Jacobs, successful cities are those with safe sidewalks. How to keep the sidewalks safe? Not the frequent patrol of police, nor the security cameras. It requires active public lives that take place on the sidewalks, in the same time, a well-defined boundary, both physical and psychological, to protect what is private. This is a scenario that is analogous to the challenges we are facing today. A better society will protect and enrich the lives of those who helped building it. The sidewalk of those who built their houses facing away from it is never going to be a safe one to walk on.

Therefore, how to bring "the public side" out of individuals is of paramount importance to the success of this project. To raise the will, or lower the threshold for people to engage in public affairs. After all, this project is not aiming to pull people out of the Matrix and fight for humanity while living underground, traveling in pipes. Although, it is identically difficult to change one's mindset if the alternative is just not visible.

One important step is to keep the people easily informed. Information is key to raise awareness and triggering actions. We are interconnected more than ever in the history of men. Information is available everywhere. However, we use that connectivity for sheer entertainment, simply because that is all is provided with convenience. 



Yet unlike technology, the direction of our society cannot be determined by an entrepreneur, no matter how brilliant he or she is.





A wide range of newly founded projects and phenomena are on the horizon. The freedom of information movement to make governments transparent, open-source hardware and 3D printing to democratize the modes of production, social enterprises staring in Delaware, new models of localized micro economies emerging all over the world to put people before profit. These projects are growing to gradually replace the current unsustainable version of capitalism and free market economy. Properties will still be private, the market will still be free, but the people operate within it will change and boundaries will be set where there will be things that the market should not touch, and money cannot buy.

This project is aiming to be the missing piece, the glue, the catalyst, the platform, the stimulus of this type of new, self-directed, socially-aware, very-large-scale collaboration.
